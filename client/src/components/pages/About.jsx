      <p>
        My name is Peter, and I am both manager and owner of Nail125. I am a
        passionate business owner, and I have come to love my time serving the
        beautiful people of New York for the past 15 years. The recent events of
        COVID-19 unfortunately tanked my business and the morale of our workers,
        and that has been reflected in some of our negative Google Reviews.
        After much reflection, I hope to use this new website as a means to
        convey an apology for our past subpar customer service and show both our
        old and new customers who we truly are. I joined Nail125 when it was
        owned by my late parents, and I hope to continue their legacy in
        providing traditional nail treatments that are loved by many.
